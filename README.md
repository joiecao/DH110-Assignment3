# Assignment03: Users in Context 
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will help users who are new to PC building learn about PC parts and how to buy the right parts. Additionally, it will provide tutorials on putting all the pieces together, where each component should go, and how to set up a new PC. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
First time PC users/builders will be able to safely and knowledgeably navigate the sometimes very confusing PC building/tech space. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions include PC building YouTube videos and guides online. However, these sources of help vary greatly in quality and there is no single centralized place, especially for new builders getting into the hobby, to find a place to start. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Finding flash sales and ordering parts online at a more discounted rate than going to a brick and mortar store. Additionally, a review system can help buyers determine the quality of their product. At the moment, PC building knowledge is not widely known and the scene is very much an online-dominant community. 

## Step 2: Identify target users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: mostly teenagers or young adults who are interested in the hobby, however learning to build a PC is something that can be adopted by anyone of any age. The scene is mostly male. 

Preferences: Engineering or tech interested

Expertise: since the app is aimed at new users, no expertise is required. However, experienced builders should find the app helpful as well. 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely use the app while browsing PC parts or learning at home. It could also be developed into an app so that users can go into stores and use their PC parts list as a shopping guide. The primary focus will remain a learning/shopping tool. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
First, the users would read a quick crash course guide on PC building. Next, they are walked through each part and what kind of component would best suit their needs. Then, they will make a list of that they need to buy, and finally purchase the products either through the app or in a store. 

## Step 3: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
I will conduct my research using contextual inquiry/participatory observation over Discord. The session will be transcribed using Otter Voice and screen recorded using Streamlabs OBS. 

The interview will cover the following: 

1. Background questions
Ask about previous PC building experience, what the user knows about the community, if they feel that it is something too technical or difficult to get into. 

2. Observation


3. Follow-up questions a. These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.
