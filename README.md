# Assignment03: Users in Context 
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will help users who are new to PC building learn about PC parts and how to buy the right parts. Additionally, it will provide tutorials on putting all the pieces together, where each component should go, and how to set up a new PC. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
First time PC users/builders will be able to safely and knowledgeably navigate the sometimes very confusing PC building/tech space. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions include PC building YouTube videos and guides online. However, these sources of help vary greatly in quality and there is no single centralized place, especially for new builders getting into the hobby, to find a place to start. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Finding flash sales and ordering parts online at a more discounted rate than going to a brick and mortar store. Additionally, a review system can help buyers determine the quality of their product. At the moment, PC building knowledge is not widely known and the scene is very much an online-dominant community. 

## Step 2: Identify target users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: mostly teenagers or young adults who are interested in the hobby, however learning to build a PC is something that can be adopted by anyone of any age. The scene is mostly male. 

Preferences: Engineering or tech interested

Expertise: since the app is aimed at new users, no expertise is required. However, experienced builders should find the app helpful as well. 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will most likely use the app while browsing PC parts or learning at home. It could also be developed into an app so that users can go into stores and use their PC parts list as a shopping guide. The primary focus will remain a learning/shopping tool. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
First, the users would read a quick crash course guide on PC building. Next, they are walked through each part and what kind of component would best suit their needs. Then, they will make a list of that they need to buy, and finally purchase the products either through the app or in a store. 

## Step 3: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
I will conduct my research using contextual inquiry/participatory observation. The session will take place over Discord and will be transcribed using Otter Voice and screen recorded using Streamlabs OBS. 

The interview will cover the following: 

Introduction- A short overview of the interview 

Background questions/contextual inquiry- Ask about previous PC building experience, what they about the community, if they feel that it is something too technical or difficult to get into. 

Observation/User Activity- observe the user try to navigate PC part picker as well as conduct their own research on PC bulding as someone completely new to the hobby 
Asking the user to do research on PC building and observe how easy/difficult it is to find resources. 

Closing- A short wrap up of the interview as well as giving them the opportunity to ask me any questions 

## Step 4: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide

## Step 5: Conduct the research

Notes

Including a forum similar to the subreddit would be helpful 

Include places to find tutorial VIDEOS

Include careful installation tips such as not bending any of the pins in the CPU 

## Step 6: Reflection
I learned a lot from this experience, one of the main things being that I need to check if my software is working properly. My interviewee and I had to restart the session midway through because I realized my recording software wasn't picking up his voice. Making sure everything is working, then double checking on it is key. Second, I feel I could improve at directing a discussion or improvisational conversation that is not a part of the script. That way, the whole exchange could feel more natural. I struggle with this kind of on-the-spot thinking. Overall I learned quite a few things a bout what a PC builder would like to see in a website, and I will be using these insights in my design in the future.
