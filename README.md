## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will help users who are new to PC building learn about PC parts and how to buy the right parts. Additionally, it will provide tutorials on putting all the pieces together, where each component should go, and how to set up a new PC. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
First time PC users/builders will be able to safely and knowledgeably navigate the sometimes very confusing PC building/tech space. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions include PC building YouTube videos and guides online. However, these sources of help vary greatly in quality and there is no single centralized place, especially for new builders getting into the hobby, to find a place to start. 

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Finding flash sales and ordering parts online at a more discounted rate than going to a brick and mortar store. Additionally, a review system can help buyers determine the quality of their product. At the moment, PC building knowledge is not widely known and the scene is very much an online-dominant community.
